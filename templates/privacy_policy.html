                    legal
                    obligations (for example, if we are required to retain your data to comply with applicable laws),

                    retained
                    for
                    a
                    shorter period of time, except when this data is used to strengthen the security or to improve the
                    functionality
                    of Our Service, or We are legally obligated to retain this data for longer time periods.</p>
                <h3>Transfer of Your Personal Data</h3>
                <p>Your information, including Personal Data, is processed at the Company's operating offices and in any
                    other
                    places where the parties involved in the processing are located. It means that this information may
                    be
                    transferred to — and maintained on — computers located outside of Your state, province, country or
                    other
                    governmental jurisdiction where the data protection laws may differ than those from Your
                    jurisdiction.
                </p>
                <p>Your consent to this Privacy Policy followed by Your submission of such information represents Your
                    agreement
                    to
                    that transfer.</p>
                <p>The Company will take all steps reasonably necessary to ensure that Your data is treated securely and
                    in
                    accordance with this Privacy Policy and no transfer of Your Personal Data will take place to an
                    organization
                    or
                    a country unless there are adequate controls in place including the security of Your data and other
                    personal
                    information.</p>
                <h3>Delete Your Personal Data</h3>
                <p>You have the right to delete or request that We assist in deleting the Personal Data that We have
                    collected
                    about

                    contact
                    Us to request access to, correct, or delete any personal information that You have provided to Us.
                </p>
                <p>Please note, however, that We may need to retain certain information when we have a legal obligation
                    or
                    lawful
                    basis to do so.</p>
                <h3>Disclosure of Your Personal Data</h3>
                <h4>Business Transactions</h4>
                <p>If the Company is involved in a merger, acquisition or asset sale, Your Personal Data may be
                    transferred.
                    We
                    will
                    provide notice before Your Personal Data is transferred and becomes subject to a different Privacy
                    Policy.
                </p>
                <h4>Law enforcement</h4>
                <p>Under certain circumstances, the Company may be required to disclose Your Personal Data if required
                    to do
                    so
                    by
                    law or in response to valid requests by public authorities (e.g. a court or a government agency).
                </p>
                <h4>Other legal requirements</h4>
                <p>The Company may disclose Your Personal Data in the good faith belief that such action is necessary
                    to:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Comply with a legal obligation</li>
                    <li>Protect and defend the rights or property of the Company</li>
                    <li>Prevent or investigate possible wrongdoing in connection with the Service</li>
                    <li>Protect the personal safety of Users of the Service or the public</li>
                    <li>Protect against legal liability</li>
                </ul>
                <h3>Security of Your Personal Data</h3>
                <p>The security of Your Personal Data is important to Us, but remember that no method of transmission
                    over
                    the
                    Internet, or method of electronic storage is 100% secure. While We strive to use commercially
                    acceptable
                    means
                    to protect Your Personal Data, We cannot guarantee its absolute security.</p>

                    Data

                    information from Our servers.</p>
                <p>If We need to rely on consent as a legal basis for processing Your information and Your country

                    consent
                    from a parent, We may require Your parent's consent before We collect and use that information.</p>
